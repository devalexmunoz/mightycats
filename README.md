Mighty Cats is a fully on-chain gaming experience built on the Flow blockchain. Players adopt a unique MightyCat NFT to enter the game, then complete in-game actions to earn experience points (XP), level up, and unlock new content.

## ‚ú® Built on Flow

This project is proudly built on the **Flow blockchain**, utilizing the Cadence smart contract language for all on-chain logic.

### Smart Contracts

The Cadence smart contracts for this project are located in the `/storage/flow/contracts` directory. The deployed contract addresses are as follows:

| Contract         | Testnet Address      | Mainnet Address |
| ---------------- | -------------------- | --------------- |
| `MightyCat`      | `0xaaf7be86aa51ba7d` | `TBD`           |
| `MightyCatsGame` | `0xaaf7be86aa51ba7d` | `TBD`           |
